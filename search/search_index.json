That's enough to run some demos and labs in this repository, but not all of them. As of time of writing Github provides 120-core/hours of Codespaces for free each month. That is approximately 30 hours a month with 4 CPUs. If you need bigger machines, please contact Github support to enable them. Keep in mind though, that Github may ask for a payment option to enable them and free time will run out faster with bigger instances. Github spending limit is always zero by default. That means you remain in full control of your expenses, unless you change the spending limit.</p> <p>WARNING!</p> <p>Do NOT enable pre-builds! This may lead to excessive use of Codespaces storage across different regions and increased costs / reduced free time. We don't need Codespaces pre-builds for any demo and to speed up the container start we simply rely on Github packages that are free for public repositories.</p>"},{"location":"#set-required-tokens-before-you-start","title":"Set Required Tokens Before You Start","text":"<p>Danger</p> <p>Do NOT set your tokens under the repository settings!
